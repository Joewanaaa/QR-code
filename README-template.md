## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to create a simple responsive QR code compenent for this challenge using sematic HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I also learned how to implement a font from google and use all the resources I have when I got stuck with narrowing the size of a column from Bootstrap.

### Continued development

I'll continue to study more about the the differences of the sizing (%,px,rem) and when to use them as I get easily confused when using it.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap - Card component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/) - This help me a lot with the layout, specially when resizing the card. I have tried doing it on my own but margins, padding don't work, obviously I need to learn more because it was not the padding or margins I need to adjust BUT the width which was already included in the style.
All in all bootstrap document preety much helped me with everything I needed.
