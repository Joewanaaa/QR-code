## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to create a simple responsive QR code compenent for this challenge using sematic HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I also learned how to implement a font from google and use all the resources I have when I got stuck with narrowing the size of a column from Bootstrap.

### Continued development

I'll continue to study more about the the differences of the sizing (%,px,rem) and when to use them as I get easily confused when using it.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap - Card component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/) - This help me a lot with the layout, specially when resizing the card. I have tried doing it on my own but margins, padding don't work, obviously I need to learn more because it was not the padding or margins I need to adjust BUT the width which was already included in the style.
All in all bootstrap document preety much helped me with everything I needed.
